This is Task 11
Describe the Difference between:
1. Lang-Chain
2. RAG
3. LLMs
4. FAISS
5. Vector
6. VectorDB
7. Generative AI 
8. GANs


--> **Lang-Chain**:
      It is a Python framework to build applications using Large Language Models.

--> **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:
      It is a technique that improves LLM answers by retrieving relevant documents and then generating responses based on them.

--> **LLMs (Large Language Models)**:
      AI models trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human language.

--> **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
      A library created by Facebook for fast similarity search of vectors.

--> **Vector**:
       A list of numbers (embedding) that represents text (or image/audio) in numerical format.

--> **VectorDB (Vector Database)**:
      A database designed to store and search vectors efficiently.

--> **Generative AI**:
      AI that creates new content such as text, images, audio, or code.

--> **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**:
      A class of generative AI models with two networks:
          Generator (creates fake data),
          Discriminator (judges real vs. fake).
